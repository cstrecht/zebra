## ðŸ¦“ Zebra Project

The Zebra Project is a Marketing Website to sell a potencial product: the Adler Typewriter.
My primary aim for this project was to introduce a method for sending automated emails directly to users' inboxes.

To accomplish this I used [Resend](https://resend.com/), a tool for interfacing with APIs and effortlessly dispatching emails to designated email addresses. Additionally, I integrated [react.email](https://react.email/) for creating aesthetically pleasing and responsive email templates.

In addition, The Zebra Project also features a user-friendly form with built-in validation to enhance the user experience.
